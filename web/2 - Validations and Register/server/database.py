"""
This modules handles database connection and session creation aspects
of the app.

The SQLAlchemy Object Relational Mapper presents a method of associating
user-defined Python classes with database tables, and instances of those
classes (objects) with rows in their corresponding tables. It includes a
system that transparently synchronizes all changes in state between
objects and their related rows, called a unit of work, as well as a
system for expressing database queries in terms of the user defined
classes and their defined relationships between each other.

# models or classes (the ORM models):
# When using the ORM, the configurational process starts by describing
# the database tables weâ€™ll be dealing with, and then by defining our
# own classes which will be mapped to those tables.
# Classes mapped using the Declarative system are defined in terms of
# a base class which maintains a catalog of classes and tables relative
# to that base - this is known as the declarative base class. Our
# application will usually have just one instance of this base in a
# commonly imported module. We create the base class using the 
# declarative_base() function, as done above.
